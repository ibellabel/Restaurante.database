# Restaurante.database
this project focuses on the desing and development of relational of a relational database for comprehensive restaurant management, addressing real-world issues caused by manual and fragmented information handling. 
the database centralizes and manages information related to:
- Customers
- Reservations and tables
- Orders and billing
- Employees and roles
- Dishes and categories
- Inventory and ingredients
- Purchases and suppliers
- Customer reviews
the main goal is to improve operational efficiency, reduce errors, and support data analysis for informed decision-making

# Objectives
- Design an Entity–Relationship (ER) model for a restaurant.
- Transform the ER model into a normalized relational model (3NF).
- Define a complete data dictionary.
- Implement the database using MySQL.
- Insert test data to validate system functionality.
- Enable data analysis and reporting for restaurant operations.

# System scope
The system covers the following processes:
- Customer and reservation management
- Table administration
- Order tracking and management
- Billing and payment methods
- Inventory and ingredient control
- Supplier purchases
- Service evaluation through customer reviews

# Technologies Used
MySQL – Database management system
SQL – Data definition and manipulation language
Entity–Relationship Modeling
Relational Model (Third Normal Form – 3NF)

# Data Model

The project includes:
Entity–Relationship model
Normalized relational schema
Core tables such as:
Customer
Table
Reservation
Order
Invoice
Dish
Employee
Inventory
Supplier
Purchase
Review
Each table includes:
Primary keys
Foreign keys
Integrity constraints (CHECK, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
Well-defined relationships

# Data Dictionary
A detailed data dictionary was created for each table, specifying:
Attribute name
Data type
Primary and foreign keys
Constraints
Functional description of each attribute
This ensures clarity, consistency, and scalability of the database.

# Database Implementation
The database was implemented in MySQL using:
CREATE DATABASE
CREATE TABLE
Foreign key constraints
Referential integrity rules
Normalization up to Third Normal Form (3NF)

# Test Data
A minimum of six records per table were inserted in order to:
Validate table relationships
Test SQL queries
Simulate real restaurant scenarios
